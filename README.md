# AITopStaff - Bot Marketplace

Welcome to AITopStaff, a project aimed at creating a marketplace for bots where users can access a variety of existing bots or create their own custom bots.

## Project Description

AITopStaff is a platform that aims to facilitate access to specialized bots in various fields of work, from medicine to engineering. Users can explore existing bots, filter them by profession, language, rating, etc., or create their own bot through a registration process and a questionnaire.

## Mockups

1. **Home Page**: The home page contains main buttons that direct to other sections of the site, along with featured images showcasing existing bots and the option to create a new bot.

2. **Existing Bots Page**: In this section, users can browse a list of existing bots with a brief description. Filters are also included to search for bots by profession, language, rating, etc.

3. **Create Your Own Bot Page**: Here, users can register or log in to access a questionnaire that will guide them in creating their own custom bot.

4. **Bot Detail Page**: Once a user selects a specific bot, they can access a dedicated page where they will find detailed information about the bot, as well as a short video demonstrating its functionality.
